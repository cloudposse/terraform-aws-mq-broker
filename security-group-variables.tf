    Set `true` to enable Terraform `create_before_destroy` behavior on the created security group.
    We only recommend setting this `false` if you are importing an existing security group

    When `false` and `security_group_create_before_destroy` is `true`, changes to security group rules
    cause a new security group to be created with the new rules, and the existing security group is then
    replaced with the new one, eliminating any service interruption.
    When `true` or when changing the value (from `false` to `true` or from `true` to `false`),
    existing security group rules will be deleted before new ones are created, resulting in a service interruption,
    but preserving the security group itself.
    **NOTE:** Setting this to `true` does not guarantee the security group will never be replaced,
    it only keeps changes to the security group rules from triggering a replacement.
    See the [terraform-aws-security-group README](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-security-group) for further discussion.

    A list of Security Group rule objects to add to the created security group, in addition to the ones
    this module normally creates. (To suppress the module's rules, set `create_security_group` to false
    and supply your own security group(s) via `associated_security_group_ids`.)
    The keys and values of the objects are fully compatible with the `aws_security_group_rule` resource, except
    for `security_group_id` which will be ignored, and the optional "key" which, if provided, must be unique and known at "plan" time.

#### We do not expose an `additional_security_group_rule_matrix` input for a few reasons:
# - It is a convenience and ultimately provides no rules that cannot be provided via `additional_security_group_rules`
# - It is complicated and can, in some situations, create problems for Terraform `for_each`
# - It is difficult to document and easy to make mistakes using it
