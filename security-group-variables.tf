    The keys and values of the objects are fully compatible with the `aws_security_group_rule` resource, except
    for `security_group_id` which will be ignored, and the optional "key" which, if provided, must be unique and known at "plan" time.

#### We do not expose an `additional_security_group_rule_matrix` input for a few reasons:
# - It is a convenience and ultimately provides no rules that cannot be provided via `additional_security_group_rules`
# - It is complicated and can, in some situations, create problems for Terraform `for_each`
# - It is difficult to document and easy to make mistakes using it
